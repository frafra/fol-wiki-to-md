Introduction

This page has been created to report the Fedora Activity Day Held in Milan on October 27. Here in Italy this day was dedicated to Linux Day, and and was a good occasion for presenting fedora.

Venue
-----

Politecnico di Milano. As wrote in the wiki we had two classrooms available because while we held some quickly sessions about the contribution in the Fedora Project and the knowledge and tools these activities require, in parallel we held also a pratical packaging session. In our thoughts, this classroom would also served for a pratical localisation session, but the people wasn't very interested about this demonstration.

Attendees
---------

The event was attended by about 30 people that were very interested to our view of 'free software/open source' and to the concepts that represent Fedora worldwide. Many people came in and out, but we didn't counted them.

Presentations
-------------

The first speech was the introduction to the Project by [Marina Latini](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Deneb) which invited all the attendants to contribute, talkin about the groups of interest. She submitted the activities within The Fedora Project and in particular the ones will be explained in the session.
The second speech was held by [Gianluca Sforna](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Giallu) who treated the packaging (a very interesting session for those who wish understand rpms), explaining how to start making their own rpm and which items are required to completely agree the Fedora guidelines. He was really clear and the session understandable at all.
Then Gianluca moved to the second room where he started the pratical session, clear as in the theoric part.
First he recommended the devolopment tools installation, then he proceeded to illustrate the voices, and their meaning, of the section inside the .spec file, focusing about the importance to have a very well done .spec file, with all the dependencies, following the right Fedora Project rules as well.
Once tuned the .spec file, Gianluca started with the compiling test, helping those who were in trouble explaining the mistakes they made.
Then was time for [Robert Mayr](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Robyduck) to explain the websites group, telling us which kind of software we need to work with them, which knowledge we must have and wichi tools, as git, we must use.
He specified the ticketing system on trac to coordinate the workgroup.

The work of the infrastructure team has been treated by [Andrea Veri](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Averi), which demonstrated the workflow of this group very interesting.
He spoke about the software, the operations and the importance of the documentation.
.

Design group was explained by Samuel Iuri, a young contributor in this team. He illustrated the guidelines and the differences between a fake and real Fedora logo.
We learned that the colours are very important for the Fedora community, and we can't use a palette unapproved by the Fedora Project.
He also illustrated which software we could use for drawning.
One of the most important talk of this event was the localisation team.
[Mario Santagiuliana](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Marionline) explained the hard and important work of the l10n team.
He said that if we can use the operating system in our mothertongue we owe it to this group, that is able to translate from english to their language.
Every country has his own group, and every group has a lot of work on his shoulders. They are aided by a system software that allow them to translate more easy than by hand.
The explanation of the kernel build and the fedora way to make was reserved to a volunteer that has experience in the kernel modules.
Federico Vaga talked about the kernel concepts and the approach a user must have.
He began from the kernel download, then he focused on the .config file and the patches.
Lastly he explained how to compile a kernel with patch by using the tools that Fedora provides.
The last argument of this day was strictly bound to the Linux Day, which was dedicated to "The Free Software in Small and Medium Enterprise"
We didn't wanted to talk about a server use of our distribution, so we asked to Massimiliamo Bugni, another volunteer, if he was able to talk about the Fedora use in this context.
The way he talked was amazing and his speech about the virtualization and the building of its own livecd was very interesting for all the people.

Gadgets
-------

There were distributed Fedora 17 DVDs , stickers and pins.

The requests have been in relation to the most various types of objects, but the stickers found the most success.

Dinner
------

Tired but happy we went to a pub where beer and pizza were waiting for us. We talked about the next events we will keep around our Country and the future steps the Italian Ambassador will do. At the end, we went home.

The End
-------

Thanks to everyone for participating. We'll see you next time.
